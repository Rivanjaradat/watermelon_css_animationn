        <h1>Free palestine </h1>
        <p>After the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel took control of Gaza and the West Bank, and imposed a ban on Palestinian national symbols such as the Palestinian flag and its colors throughout the occupied territories. In response to this restriction, Palestinians began using the red, black, white, and green colors associated with the Palestinian flag in unconventional ways. One notable expression of resistance was the use of watermelon as a symbolic gesture. The red color of watermelon was considered a representation of the colors of the Palestinian flag. This act of waving a watermelon in the face of Israeli forces turned into a form of protest and defiance against the ban, making it a powerful and innovative way to express solidarity with Palestine. This symbolic act can be observed in various parts of the world during pro-Palestinian marches and through countless social media posts, especially in response to ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza.</p>
