        <h1>Free palestine </h1>
         <p>After 1967, a ban was imposed on Palestinian national symbols such as the Palestinian flag and its colors throughout the occupied territories. In response to this restriction, Palestinians began using the red, black, white, and green colors associated with the Palestinian flag in unconventional ways. One notable expression of resistance was the use of watermelon as a symbolic gesture. . This act of waving a watermelon in the face of Israeli forces has turned into a form of protest and defiance against the ban, making it a powerful and innovative way to express solidarity with Palestine. This symbolic act can be observed in various parts of the world during pro-Palestinian marches and through countless social media posts, especially in response to ongoing Israeli actions in Gaza.</p>
